			<h1>Why I Code</h1>
			<p>I have a passion for solving problems by creating software to interact with the world around me. This passion drives me to be the best I can be, and has kept me exploring changes in technology. 
			<br><br>
			 When I was seven my brother taught me how to make a simple quiz script in Bash. Since then I have continued to challenge myself to learn and create. Most recently I have immersed myself in machine learning. It is a very difficult topic, but what keeps me pushing forward is knowing I will have the ability to change the world if I can use machine learning in a creative way.

		<section class = "work-bio">
			<h1>Professional Bio</h1>
			<p> I have 2.5 years of professional experience. I primarily use Java, Python, and MySQL. Over my career, I have developed sofware including a checkout processing system, queries to automatically detect at risk clients, a data scraper for thousands of cars, and a multi-regional database using Cassandra and AWS.
