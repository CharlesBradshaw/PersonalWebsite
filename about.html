						Baking
					</div>
					<div class = "right">
						Last year I tried my hand at making a loaf of bread. The first few loaves weren't particurarly edible, but after sixteen tries I think I got the perfect loaf. Since then I've made pasta and croissants.

						StarCraft
					</div>
					<div class = "right">
						The best way I've heard Starcraft described is like a game of chess where you can move every piece simultaneously while building more pieces. The realtime element of starcraft makes it hard to master, but even as an average player I have a lot of fun.

						Minecraft
					</div>
					<div class = "right">
						Minecraft taught me a lot about computer science. There are blocks called "redstone" that transmit a value of 1 or 0. Using these binary blocks I ended up learning how to make a calculator with different logic gates. Now when I play minecraft I use the mod pack tekkit, which adds different blocks like nuclear reactors and terminals.

						Counter Strike
					</div>
					<div class = "right">
						Counter Strike is the most realistic shooter I've ever played. Two bullets and you're almost guarenteed to be dead. If you run while you shoot you're going to miss. Though, my favorite aspect is how much you have to work with your team. Everyone has valuable information, and if you don't communicate you will lose.

						Snowboarding
					</div>
					<div class = "right">
						This winter I went snowboarding for the first time since I was a kid. My friends and I took a trip up to Snowshoe and stayed for a week. I forgot how bad I was at snowboarding, but towards the end of the week I was going down black diamonds. We all bought our own gear so we're ready to go back next year.

						Outdoor Adventures
					</div>
					<div class = "right">
						Sometimes I want to get outside and interact with nature. Every other month or so I'll go kayaking, rafting, or biking on a trail. Those activities have kept me satisfied but I plan on going on a hike or camping sooner than later

						Master Machine Learning
					</div>
					<div class = "right">
						The ultimate potential of machine learning is to replicate human abilities, and while I doubt we'll get there in my lifetime, I am excited to see what breathroughs do occur. I truly believe that machine learning can solve the world's biggest problems. This is why I want to be able to speak intelligently about the field and why I keep learning.

						Learn To Surf
					</div>
					<div class = "right">
						Since I enjoyed getting back into snowboarding so much, I want a sport I can do in the summer. I've always been interested in surfing, and when it gets warmer I plan on heading to the beach.

						Improve At Cooking
					</div>
					<div class = "right">
						About two years ago I went vegan. I would still make that choice again today, but it isn't an easy diet to cook for. There is always some trade off. I've yet to find a meal that is tasty, cheap, quick, and high in protein. I'm sure there is a way I can naviage the kitchen, but I haven't put in the time to know how (yet).
